Everybody can use the below endpoints to access the tables in the database.


* _/register_ - POST into Users table.

* _/tracking_ (POST) - POST into Rawdata table.
* _/tracking_ (GET) - takes a JSON object with 'routeId' and 'deviceTime' to give back Livedata with respect to input.
```
routeId==None and deviceTime==None:
	returns Livedata of all Buses
routeId!=None and deviceTime==None:
	returns Livedata of given routeId
routeId!=None and deviceTime!=None:
	returns Tracking of given routeId at given deviceTime
```
* _/sms_ - sends SMS in bulk. takes a JSON object with 'to' and 'message'.
```
if 'to'=='users': given message is sent to all Users.
if 'to'=='drivers': given message is sent to all Drivers.
```
* _/geofence_ (POST) - POST into Geofence table.
* _/geofence_ (GET) - takes a JSON object with 'routeId','fromDate','toDate','status'. 'fromDate' and 'toDate' are must.
```
if 'routeId' is given, data related only to that 'routeId' is returned else everything is returned.
if 'status' is given, data with given status only is returned else everything is returned.
```
* _/busgeofence_ (POST) - POST into BusGeofence table.
* _/busgeofence_ (DELETE) - takes a JSON object with 'routeId' and deletes all the rows from BusGeofence table with the given 'routeId'.
* _/busgeofence_ (GET) - takes a JSON object with 'routeId'.
```
if 'routeId'!=None:
	returns a list of latitudes and logitudes detetrmining bus geofence.
if 'routeId'==None:
	returns a list of latitudes and logitudes detetrmining bus geofence for all routes.
```
* _/alerts_ (POST) - POST into Alerts table.
* _/alerts_ (GET) - takes a JSON object with 'routeId' and 'alertDate'. 'alertDate' is must.
```
if 'routeId'!=None:
	returns a list of alerts generated on given 'alertDate'.
if 'routeId'==None:
	returns a list of alerts generated by given 'routeId' on given 'alertDate'.
```
* _/alertscontrol_ (POST) - POST into AlertsControl Table.
* _/alertscontrol_ (DELETE) - takes a JSON object with 'alertCode' and deletes the AlertControl with the given 'alertCode'.
* _/alertscontrol_ (GET) - AlertsControl Table.
* _/reports/uptime_ - takes a JSON object with 'routeId', 'fromDate', 'toDate'. 'fromDate', 'toDate' are must.
```
if routeId==None:
	returns uptime data of all buses between given dates
if routeId!=None:
	returns uptime data of given bus between given dates
```
* _/reports/fleet_ - takes a JSON object with 'routeId', 'fromDate', 'toDate'.
```
if fromDate and toDate == None:
	if routeId==None:
		returns all fleet data of all buses 
	if routeId!=None:
		returns all fleet data of given bus
if fromDate and toDate != None:
	if routeId==None:
		returns fleet data of all buses between given dates
	if routeId!=None:
		returns fleet data of given bus between given dates
```
* _/reports/distance_ - takes a JSON object with 'routeId', 'fromDate', 'toDate'. 'fromDate', 'toDate' are must.
```
if routeId==None:
	returns distance travelled data of all buses between given dates
if routeId!=None:
	returns distance travelled data of given bus between given dates
```
* _/reports/alerts_ - takes a JSON object with 'alertCode', 'fromDate', 'toDate'. 'fromDate', 'toDate' are must.
```
if alertCode==None:
	returns all alerts buses between given dates
if alertCode!=None:
	returns all alerts of given type between given dates
```
* _/buses_ - Bus table
.
* _/routes_ - Routes table
.
* _/drivers_ - Driver table.
* _/sos_ - Sos table
.
* _/users_ - Users table
.

Example: _ec2-3-7-131-60.ap-south-1.compute.amazonaws.com/routes_

All the endpoints returns the data as a list of dictionaries in JSON format which can be converted and used in the program directly.
